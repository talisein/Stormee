**** THIS PYTHON APPLICATION IS DEPRECIATED ****


The code in this directory is for historical purposes only.

If you want to use it you will have to tell it where the html files
are now located. The glade file may or may not be different from what
the code expects, so you could have to deal with that too.

As of 18 OCT 2011, here are the features the C++ version doesn't have:
* An applet sitting in the dock
* Parsing of VTEC strings in weather related messages
* RSS polling


Dependancies:
python
pygtk
lxml
dateutil
pywebkitgtk
pynotify

This program monitors feed that provide emergency notifications in the
"Common Alerting Protocol" or CAP xml-encapsulation. CAP is an OASIS
standard and should become increasingly prevalent.

The largest producer of CAP messages that I've found so far is the
National Weather Service. The USGS also has a feel for large
earthquakes, and the state of California has a statewide feed as
well. To learn more about CAP, check out

Currently, this program hits up all three of the above feeds, and if
the event includes the area the user is in a notification is displayed
and, through the status tray, you can see all the details of the
message. Right now you have to edit tray.py and change LATLONG_COORDS,
FIPSCODE and UGCCODE to get the right filtering. Other than that the
application is pretty functional.

To get it to run you have to execute it from the src directory,
because I don't know how to make an installer or .desktop file or
anything proper like that.
